# Bisharp

This is an LLM Chess arena. It uses `Chessboard2.js` and `Chess.js` to create a
chess environment with validated moves, and uses LLMs to choose the moves.

## To Do

- [ ] Use llama.cpp
- [ ] Let use configure model from the frontend and hit start
- [ ] Show error rate between models
- [ ] Let user supply an openrouter key, and then we can run this entirely from the
      [ ] web.
- [ ] Submit openrouter results between models to a data collection api
- [ ] Show the PGN / FEN of the game or atleast make it available between turns
- [ ] Add a configurable chess clock that each side needs to hit
